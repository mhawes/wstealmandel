The two subdirectories of implementation house the (OLD) serial implementation (mandelbrot)
and the work stealing implementation (wsmandelbrot).

To Compile:
run make in the wsmandelbrot directory.

All binaries are places in the `bin' sub-directory. These are as follows:
* wsmandelbrot: Random Work-Stealing Algorithm is Applied. This is the main focus of the project.
* semandelbrot: A serial version of the level set mandelbrot algorithm.
* rtmandelbrot: An alternative Work-Stealing Scheme (unfinished)
* nsmandelbrot: A `Naive' parallel scheme is employed.
* inmandelbrot: A `Naive' parallel scheme is employed where work is distributed in an 
                interleaved fashion. (Not relevent to the report or Scope of the Project)
